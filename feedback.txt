	Step 1: We used Checkstyle to make sure the code was readable according to publicly agreed upon standards.
	Step 2: We made all fileIO related methods and tests throw IOException to account for when a file is not found.
	    If a file is not found, is does not make sense to just return an empty list, as we should instead tell the user that they are attempting to read a non-present file.
	    We also changed some of the tests to throw the IOException.
	Step 3: We noticed that the vehiclesInsured field was unnecessarily declared as an Integer in the Customer class, so we converted it to an int.
	Step 4: The Customer class was using a String for the totalMonthlyPremium because of a dollar sign, so we converted it to an int.
	    This makes future use of the value much more intuitive and meaningful.

Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	Step 1: We used Checkstyle to make sure the code was readable according to publicly agreed upon standards.
	Step 2: We made all fileIO related methods and tests throw IOException to account for when a file is not found.
	    If a file is not found, is does not make sense to just return an empty list, as we should instead tell the user that they are attempting to read a non-present file.
	    We also changed some of the tests to throw the IOException.
	Step 3: We noticed that the vehiclesInsured field was unnecessarily declared as an Integer in the Customer class, so we converted it to an int.
	Step 4: The Customer class was using a String for the totalMonthlyPremium because of a dollar sign, so we converted it to an int.
	    This makes future use of the value much more intuitive and meaningful.
	    We also updated the test values in the JUnit to reflect the better implementation.
	Step 5: We improved the javadocs for all of the provided methods to make their use easier.
	    We also generated the javadoc HTML for this project, so that they can be more easily referenced. These can be found in src/main/java/javadocs/index.html
	Step 6: We created 2 methods in the CsvUtil class that can be used to find other patterns in the data.
	    We created getCustomersBasedOnNumberOfPolicies and getVendorsForCustomerBasedOnArea.
	    We also created tests for these two methods.
	Step 7: We implemented the Builder pattern for each of the data classes. Although unused for this implementation, builders are a very helpful design pattern to use when a constructor has many hard-to-remember parameters.
	    If a user wanted to add functionality for creating objects and writing to CSV, rather than reading, the builder would prove very valuable for code readability/maintainability.
	
	
Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events?
Some of the requirements in the javadocs wre a bit unclear.
    For #5, we had to do customer.getYearsOfService() == yearsOfService
    But for #7, we had to do vendor.getVendorRating() >= vendorRating
    Whether or not we use > or == was a bit unclear and required us to guess as to why the tests failed.
